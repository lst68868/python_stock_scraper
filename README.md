During COVID, I worked as an assistant manager for a wealth management firm. Aside from standard duties (research/analysis, admin, client relations, etc.),
I took it upon myself to automate several analyst tasks, including teaching myself Python in order to extract and publish stock market data for
senior partnership. Additional self-taught work included Salesforce and Excel automation that cannot be published here due to firm 
and client privacy concerns.
